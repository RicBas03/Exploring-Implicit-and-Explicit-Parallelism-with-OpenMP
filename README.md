### Repository contents
• homework1.c: code containing all the implementations
described.
• homework1.pbs: that runs the program for every matrix
size.

### Instructions
1) Install GCC compiler
2) Clone the repository
3) Compile the program with 'gcc −o es homework1.c −
fopenmp − O2'
4) Run the program with './es N', where N is the matrix
size.
5) Alternatively run the PBS with 'qsub homework1.pbs'
(remember to modify the directory path).
